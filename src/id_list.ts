/*
 IdList implementation using a modified B+Tree.

 See tests/id_list_simple.ts for a simpler implementation with the same API but
 impractical efficiency (linear time ops; one object in memory per id).
 The fuzz tests compare that implementation to this one.

 The B+Tree is unusual in that it has no keys, only values (= ids). The order on the values
 is determined "by fiat" using insertAfter/insertBefore instead of using sorted keys.

 The leaves in the B+Tree are not individual ids; instead, each leaf is a compressed representation of a groups of ids
 with the same bunchId and sequential counters. Each leaf also contains a `present`
 field to track which of its ids are deleted.
 (Unlike in a SavedIdList, we do not separate adjacent ids with different isDeleted statuses.)

 Note that it is possible for adjacent leaves to be mergeable (i.e., they could be one leaf) but not merged.
 This happens if you insert the middle ids later (e.g., 0, 2, 1).
 It has a slight perf penalty that goes away once you reload.
 Note that save() needs to work around this possibility - see pushSaveItem.

 The B+Tree also stores two statistics about each subtree: its size (# of present ids)
 and its knownSize (# of known ids). These allow indexed access in log time.

 Unlike some B+Trees, we do not store a linked list of leaves. Iteration instead uses a depth-first search.

 Finally, we also store a "bottom-up" view of the B+Tree, in order to quickly find the leaf or
 tree path corresponding to an ElementId. Each inner node is assigned a unique sequence number
 (seq), and we store a persistent map from each leaf to its parent's seq (leafMap)
 and from each inner node's seq to its parent's seq (parentSeqs). Because leafMap is sorted
 by (LeafNode.bunchId, LeafNode.startCounter), we can also use it to lookup the leaf corresponding
 to an ElementId, e.g., for IdList.has.
